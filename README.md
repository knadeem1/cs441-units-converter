Project 1: Weight Converter

Description: This weight converter will calculate how much you would weigh on other planets. Your weight is different on other planets because gravity is different, although your mass stays the same. We calculate weight by multiplying masss by the gravity on the surface of the planet. This application requires you to enter you mass and pick a planet of your preference to determine how much you would weigh.
